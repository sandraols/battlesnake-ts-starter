# Preparations before K-day

We have gathered instructions for 4 different hosting solutions. There are som pros and cons with all so you have to pick the one suiting you. You can always host your Battlesnake in other places if you want.

- Replit. Supereasy to get started but you have to use a browser based IDE.
- Railway. You can develop on your machine and let Railway build your app when pushed to Github. But you need to give the Railway App access to your Github account.
- Render. You can develop locally just like Railway but you don't need to give access to you repo. The build is however very slow. 

## Replit

Replit is a free browser based hosting and IDE. You will edit your files directly in the browser with their built in IDE.

1. Go to https://replit.com/ and create an account.
2. Click "+ Create" to create a new Repl.
3. Choose "Import from github".
4. Paste "github.com/ola-gawell-dct/battlesnake-ts-starter" as GitHub URL.
5. Choose Typescript from Language.
6. Click "Import from GitHub".
7. Click "Run" to build your project and launch the server. This will takes some time the first time since it needs to install all the npm dependencies. The next time will be much faster. 
8. When you see `Running Battlesnake at http://0.0.0.0:8000...` in the log the server is up and running. A small browser window will show up.
9. Copy the URL from the small browser window and use it in the next section. NOTE: It can somtimes take a while for the first request to the server to repond. The server might go into sleep mode after som inactivity so its good to call your url before the big finals.

## Railway

Railway is a free browser based hosting.

7. When you see `Running Battlesnake at http://0.0.0.0:6774...` in the log the server is up and running.
8. Copy the URL from settings and use it in the next section.

## Render

11. 

## Heroku

NOTE: Heroku is not longer free to use. You can still use it but these instructions might not be complete anymore. 

By following these instructions your server will be depolyed to Heroku. It is possible to host the server in any way you want as long as it is publicly accessible. The following instructions assumes that you want to use Heroku hosting.

If you don't want to install or use the Heroku CLI it is also possible to integrate Heroku with a Github repo, but that is not covered by this guide (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install Heroku CLI (might requiere a XCode and MacOS update on Mac) and create a Heroku account.
    https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli
3. Run `heroku login`.
4. Remove the git directory in this repo `rm -rf .git`.
5. Initialize a fresh git repo `git init`.
6. Commit all files 
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
7. Create a heroku app `heroku create your-app-name`.
8. Deploy your code `git push heroku main`. 

    **NOTE** if you encounter an error messsge saying something the one below, you're trying to push a branch that doesn't exist.

    ````
    error: src refspec master does not match any  
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://git.heroku.com/most-super-snake.git'
    ````
    
    Change to the branch your're current using, for instance `master`.
    
9. Verify by browsing to the URL printed by the last command. 
    
    ````
    remote: -----> Launching...
    remote:        Released v3
    remote:        https://most-super-snake.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku <---- THIS ONE 
    ````
